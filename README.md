# Senior-Design-Project-F-SAE-Aero-Package-
I was appointed as the leader of the aero sub-team in which I was responsible for developing an aero package for the car. Taking into consideration time and cost constrains, we decided to focus on 3 main aero devices which are nosecone, sidepods, and undertray. I solely worked on the CFD analysis and optimization in which I compared many CAD parts that I helped designed as well. IThe fabrication part was carried by me and other subteam members. The results are as follows: 
Obtained at speed 80 kph = 22.2222 m/s , density of 1.162 kg/m^3 , reference/ frontal area = 0.29 m^2  . Main aspects of car (nosecone + side panels  ) 
Net total drag force = 60.7 N 
Net Total drag coefficient= 0.7289
Net total downforce = 28.5 N 
Net total downforce coefficient = 0.3429
L/D = 0.47 
Downforce generated by nosecone = 9.0196 N , note that nosecone is the only frontal aerodynamic component that generates downforce
% front down force (over the front axle) =  (down force of nose cone / total down force )*100% 
=  (9.0196 / 28.5 )*100% = 31.65 %
